# EHub_BaratiAdapt_v1
Preliminary GAMS model inspired by the reference Energy Hub optimization paper. The study aims to minimize total energy costs through optimal scheduling of CHP, boiler, chillers, and storages. This first version excludes water, hydrogen, and game-theory layers; more advanced releases will follow.
